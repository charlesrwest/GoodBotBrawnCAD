Fold loses 1.5 mm of material on each side of the fold, making the bend require 3 mm of extra material.

176.5 mm after folding

Clearances on the mating of the camera battery hook to the front of the battery case too tight.  Need more space.

Doesn't seem to want to go down all the way.  Camera battery hook standing up about 1 mm too high.

Clearance between the bottom of the nano holder and the base where the fold occurs seems too low.  Need to shorten the bottom of the nano base?  Probably should mount nano first to make sure that it doesn't make the nano not fit.

Battery holder hole diameters for bolts seem ok.  Could maybe go a bit looser if insertion turns out to be a pain.  As is they screw in, which might be handy because it could be partially inserted before putting it into the robot.

Wouldn't hurt to have the bolts be about 1 mm longer.

Wouldn't hurt to have the bolt hole about 1 mm further out from the fold scoring line.

Move bolt mounting tables folding indicator dots all the way to the edge and remove the ones on the mounting tabs themselves.
